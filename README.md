## groupie-tracker-visualizations

### Objectives

We must follow the same [principles](https://01.alem.school/git/root/public/src/branch/master/subjects/groupie-tracker/README.md) as the first subject.

Groupie tracker visualizations consists of manipulating the data coming from the API and displaying it in the most presentable way possible to you. The [Schneiderman's 8 Golden Rules of Interface Design](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/shneiderman-s-eight-golden-rules-will-help-you-design-better-interfaces) must be followed:

- Strive for consistency
- Enable frequent users to use shortcuts
- Offer informative feedback
- Design dialogue to yield closure
- Offer simple error handling
- Permit easy reversal of actions
- Support internal locus of control
- Reduce short-term memory load
